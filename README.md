# neighborhoodproject
neighborhood messaging app

This project is to design a relational backend for an online service that allows people to communicate with others in their neighborhoods. For this project, the users can register, login, message other users who are their friends, add neighbors, reply to message in threads, apply to be in a block through a member only voting system. These are some of the functionalities. Below, I will explain the reasons behind how I establish a series of tables to manage a community-based platform where users can register, apply to specific blocks within neighborhoods, and interact through messages and relationships. I am using PostgreSQL, Flask in python to construct this application.
